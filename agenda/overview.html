                                Phew, what a long travel day it was! We spent the majority of the day on plane or bus and discovered that there are two types of stenches: the stench of being outside and hiking without showering, and the stench of sitting in closed areas with littMalahidele circulation all day. After today I think the latter of those two is worse. We woke up at 2am, to ensure that we would get to the airport in time for our 6am flight. Turns out no one else needs a Taxi at that hour (who knew?), and we were at the airport in approximately 20 minutes. Once arriving, we walked into a deserted airport and discovered that the airline desks don’t open until 2 hours before the flight, thus found ourselves with some more time on our hands. Traveling is tricky because you don’t want to miss your flight/bus/train, yet without knowing the area or procedures of the area well, I often found myself in the “hurry up and wait” mode.
                                <br><br>
                                Once in Pamplona, after a crazy sprint through the Frankfurt airport, we got a taxi to the Pamplona bus station. While we waited, we observed many other pilgrims (what they call people who walk the Camino) strolling in and it started to make the trip seem very real to us. 
                                <br><br>
                                We caught our bus to St. Jean Pied de Port, and arrived by around 4:30pm. This next part was probably my least favorite of the trip so far. Everyone gets off the buses and sprints to try and find a hostel before they fill up. It sort of feels like everyone is on edge and in competition with one another, not two traits that are typically used to describe El Camino. You feel worried about what might happen if you can’t find a bed. In the end, all worked out and we found ourselves in a great hostel! The most friendly of the other four in our room was a German man, who was very nice, however he didn’t speak too much English. We went out for some dinner and forced ourselves to stay up all the way until 8pm.

                                We returned to Howth to spend our last day in Ireland. This time, we had the fortune of walking through town with fresh eyes to watch a bustling coastal-tourist town. We made our way straight down the main road, on the north side of the peninsula. At the end appeared a walking path and Paisley and I decided to hike around to try and catch a view of this lovely part of Ireland from above. 
                                <br><br>
                                It rained during the hike, hard. Each of us wore puffy-jackets layered under our rain coats-- both soaked completely through by the end. I’ve never heard my socks make such a noise as we stomped down the path for three and a half hours searching for “a quaint pub on the return side” as Miriam put it. 
                                <br><br>
                                Additionally, we were side tracked by a deer path leading down from the coastal cliffs to the rocky beach below. This was a fun side quest that led to a half-hour worth of skipping stones and completely soaked shoes. 
                                <br><br>
                                Towards the end of the hike we climbed to the summit of a hill on par with Everest. This led us to a golf course, and then more windy trails, and eventually to <i>The Summit Inn</i>. We had lunch and enjoyed two pints of Guinness, and then walked back to town. 
                                <br><br> 
                                When we arrived back at the Airbnb, we packed our things and then eagerly went to sleep to prepare for the next day of travel.

                                Day four was quiet. We stayed inside to sip espresso and work on our blog. It was raining outside and we started to get excited about the next leg of our adventure only a few short days away. Because we are not usually in Ireland, we decided to get out of the house and visit a town with the name Malahide. 
                                <br><br>
                                The ride on the DART was short, maybe 15 minutes. Our host had mentioned a castle here, so it was decided, that would be our first stop. Not far from the station we crossed the road into a park entrance. Along the edge, a path guided us past tennis courts, a golf course, and an outdoor stadium of somesort. 
                                <br><br>
                                Eventually we came to the castle grounds. The remains of a church stood near the entrance, across the footpath from the visitor center. Tours were available to be guided through the castle, but we decided to gaze upon it from the courtyard out front, and then walk to dinner. 
                                <br><br>
                                We decided on a cozy looking restaurant to end the day. We were seated, fed fish and wine, and walked to the docks before returning home.

                                The Cliffs of Moher being as big an icon of Ireland as they are, we figured we ought to make our way out to that side of the island. In attempting to do so, we realized the biggest downside of our time in Ireland -- we do not have a car and thus need to rely on public transportation. Public transportation is actually great over here, however it really only (easily) gets you from city to city, and makes it more difficult to see of the remote/beautiful parts of Ireland, without paying for a full day tour. None-the-less, we set out to make it to Galway and see what the day brought. 
                                <br><br>
                                We took to DART to Dublin, and then got on the LUAS to Heuston station. It is here were we got on the train for the 2.5 hr ride. Beautiful views along the way, full of cute sheep! Once in Galway, we spend the day walking the streets and getting a feel for the town. We walked out to Salt Hill via the coast and ate lunch. 
                                <br><br>
                                We then walked back and were struck by a bad case of needing a nap. In the search for a place to rest our heads we continued to tour the town. We came across an old stone arch. Very eye-opening, indeed. We also saw birds fight each other in what appeared to be a territory war for rights to a rock in a strategic fishing spot. It was great to see a city we had not yet explored, but we are ready to sleep tonight!

                                    It is all at once freeing and intimidating to be able to do anything today. We started out researching the areas of Ireland and got some pro tips from our AirBnb host, Miriam. As we planned our day in the kitchen, we were able to meet some of her Grandsons, who were staying over due to it being a bank holiday today. It was fun to hear Miriam recount her Grandson’s tennis match the previous day, as we heard his opponent described as a “little pop” and other such adjectives we did not previously know could be used to describe an individual. In the end, we settled on spending the day exploring Dublin. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We went into town using the DART once again and got a great view of the city on the way in.
                                    It is incredible to see buildings that were constructed half a millenia ago-- this is a thought we shared many times as we walked through Dublin.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We hopped off of the DART on Tara street, nearly directly in the city center. From there we wandered in the direction of Trinity College, with Google Maps guiding us and assuring everyone nearby that we have no idea where we are. We found ourselves at Ha'Penny bridge to snap a photo.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We had scheduled a tour of the Book of Kells exhibit, and decided to tour the campus beforehand. We ended up with a few hours to spare before the tour began and so we spent our time walking through campus toward a spot for some lunch, and then toward a tourist information building and currency exchange. Woohoo, we now have Euros to burn ;)
                                    <br><br>
                                    The tour of the Book of Kells was a self-guided, museum-like walk. It began giving a history of how it came to be made and the journey that it took throughout time. Then, we proceeded to view the book itself, and enter a library which reminded us of the Citadel Library that Samwell Tarly worked in. It was built between 1712 and 1732, and the attention to detail was awe inspiring. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We left and shortly met up with a friend from Pacific, Rachel, who had moved to Dublin about three weeks ago. We caught up at a nearby brewery and then headed to our next stop, GUINESS! Learned a lot about Guiness, but most importantly, we drank beers with our faces on them!! Who knew you could do that? Well, we didn’t. But now we do. All in all a fun day in Dublin!

                                It’s hard to believe, but we did not take any pictures during our first day in Dublin. With that said, our first day only lasted a few short, slightly hallucinatory, hours. We stepped off of the airplane without having slept and found a taxi to take us to our Airbnb. Then, we dropped off our bags and walked to Howth. I would like to say that in the name of adventure we would have walked around no matter the circumstance, but our room was being prepared, and we had a few hours to burn before we would be allowed to stumble onto the mattress and fall into a deep sleep for the next 15 hours. 
                                <br><br>
                                Howth was incredible. A beautiful fishing village and tourist spot that has some great food and scenery. We sat down to order in a very busy restaurant, and decided on calamari, grilled tuna, and clam chowder. This was “the best clam chowder” Paisley has ever tasted. For personal reasons, I did not partake in the chowder tasting. 
                                <br><br>
                                After our meal we walked to an amphitheatre-looking area that bordered the sea, and looked out toward a small island whose name I do not know. 
                                <br><br>
                                We decided that enough time had been spent frolicking around and took the DART up two stops to our Airbnb. I fell asleep a few times during the 10 minute ride.

                                We are here having a breakfast of toast and jam, and Nespresso. The sun is shining through two large French Doors onto the dining room table, where we are sitting, making it incredibly difficult to see the screen I am typing on.

                                There are birds chirping outside that accent the beauty of this place very nicely. I am excited for what today brings.
