                                We needed no alarm this morning. I awoke to the sound of early risers rustling through their bags. It was 5:00, forty-five minutes earlier than my watch was set to alarm, but there was no point in trying to go back to sleep. 
                                <br><br>
                                I noticed Paisley had started moving around on the bunk above me, so I figured we should get moving.
                                <br><br>
                                We walked into a cold and dark morning, up the hill outside of our hostel, and through an enchanting entrance to the woods-- one that looked to be out of a fairytale. 
                                <br><br>
                                Walking through the woods was a nice change of pace to start the day with. It was dark for the first thirty minutes or so, but soon after, the sky behind us ignited. A molten horizon lit the hills and valleys below us and was shimmering through the fog and morning dew. 
                                <br><br>
                                Eventually we were passed by others and decided to take a water break. The views were not necessarily breathtaking, but sure pretty to look at. 
                                <br><br>
                                We arrived at the next town after three hours and found a seat in a back room. It was a cozy place that smelled like coffee. I ordered an espresso and Paisley ordered a Cafe con leche. We ate and rested our feet. 
                                <br><br>
                                We continued to walk through the forest and eventually arrived to a small town whose name I've forgotten. From there until we reached where we are staying, we walked on streets beside passing cars and trucks. This wasn't the most glamorous day along the Camino, but the weather has been spectacular. 
                                <br><br>
                                We reached our albergue which has a pool that is not heated or otherwise maintained, it seems. We soaked our feet for about an hour in the cold water and then walked around the village. 
                                <br><br>
                                We are waiting for dinner, and are excited about passing through a bigger city tomorrow. I lost my phone charging cable and I hope to find another one. 
                                <br><br>
                                We are trying to upload more photos to our album, but have had terrible luck with wifi. 
                                <br><br>
                                As I am writing this Paisley is planning how to orient the photos for the day, and we are sipping on Estrella Damm, looking out toward grassy hills that remind us of home.

                                It was tough to say farewell to the lovely little albergue we stayed in last night. Dinner was absolutely delicious and we had the place all to ourselves. We took the extra blankets from the other bunks to stay warm, but did not need to, as the room was very comfortable. 
                                <br><br>
                                Our dinner had four courses last night. The first was a delightful little bowl of tomato paste, vinegar, olive oil, and something else I’m sure. It paired well with the bread and wine that we had available to us. Next we were served a bowl of vegetable soup with carrots, rice, and beans, perhaps. It was salty, warm, and delicious. The third plate came with a stew of potatoes and beef. Both parts would melt in your mouth, and warmed me up from the inside. At this point I was full, but was having a hard time stopping. Dessert finally came, and I was served a bowl of fresh fruit, and Paisley had some vanilla pudding with a few dashes of cinnamon. 
                                <br><br>
                                We slept in a quiet room and felt well rested this morning. 
                                <br><br>
                                We left at 7 am, and decided we would stop at the first place open for breakfast and coffee. We made it about 10 km to Belorado, and walked into a very yellow diner/albergue, with automatic sliding glass doors. I ordered a ham sandwich, and Paisley ordered a tortilla and ham sandwich, which consisted of eggs, potatoes, and ham on a baguette. 
                                <br><br>
                                We found out that the woman serving us has visited Oregon, and spoke perfect english. She told us about the American adventures she has been on, and how she doesn’t understand why tourists so often go to see things and places that are boring. 
                                <br><br>
                                An example of this was about Hollywood. She mentioned that her dad had taken her to the States and insisted they see Hollywood. She said that this was a terrible idea that lasted a few minutes before they both got bored and tried to find something else to do. She was drawing a comparison between the Camino and these other tourist-heavy spots. 
                                <br><br>
                                She told us about a few beautiful locations that “would be a shame not to see” while we are here, and wrote them down on a piece of paper. 
                                <br><br>
                                We walked away from the conversation a bit confused, but very glad to have met her. Now we have an idea of what to do with the few extra days we have after the Camino, while we are still in Spain. 
                                <br><br>
                                We continued to walk until lunch, and then stopped to rest our feet. We had considered going 34 km today, to make it to Burgos in two days, but decided against it. I think we will focus a bit more on enjoying the journey instead trying so hard to reach the final destination.
                                <br><br>
                                We are in an albergue in <i>Villafranca Montes de Oca</i>, and are sitting in the grass in the backyard, enjoying the sun. Paisley is trying to play with a dog that was minding his own business, smelling grass and doing other dog things. He is now glaring at me.
                                <br><br>
                                We don’t know where we will go to dinner, but it is sure not going to be as tasty as last night’s meal. We will try to get rest tonight so that we can, again, enjoy another beautiful day in the Spanish Countryside.

                                We woke up to a much quieter room this morning. We slowly gathered our belongings and prepared for the rain to come. The morning mist that welcomed our faces as we began the day’s trek was reminiscent of Oregon. We walked for about 7 km, before stumbling onto a golf course. We went into the golf shop and had a much needed warm breakfast. 
                                <br><br>
                                After fueling up with some caffeine, we headed to the next big town <i>Santo Domingo de la Calzada</i>. Upon arriving here, we found an adventure shop and stopped to take a look. Alaa needed some new socks (as his currently has a few holes) and I was in need of some gloves to keep my hands warm on these chillier days, something I had failed to prepare for. Alaa also picked up some trekking poles, for his knees were “...dear god, about to explode” on some of the steeper downhill portions. Leaving the store, we felt like new hikers! 
                                <br><br>
                                Around 3 pm, we arrived at our final destination for the day: <i>Castildelgado</i>. There is only one albergue in this town, and we were anxious to see if we had picked a good place to stay. As we walked in, a welcoming older couple helped us. Upon going upstairs, we determined that we have the place to ourselves! Such a rare thing on the Camino... The place is beautiful, and apparently it was a historic house that they had restored. It has the charm of an old house, but the comforts of a new one. 
                                <br><br>
                                We are sitting in a cozy living room that is filled with the scent of a homemade meal awaiting us. I am so sorry that we have to leave in the morning.

                                I awoke multiple times in the early morning, for some reason thinking it was time to go. Then of course, as it often goes, when the multitude of alarms went off, I was not quite ready to get out of bed. None the less, we packed up and got on our way.
                                <br><br>
                                The morning sky was dark and dreary. The forecast called for rain in the afternoon, but it looked as though rain would start to pour at any moment. Our legs were stiff and feet swollen. It felt as though my feet were about to explode, leaving me with two nubs and an over-sized backpack.
                                <br><br>
                                We managed to make it to a small town roughly 6 km away from the start. We sat and drank coffee mentally preparing for the day ahead. We saw a few folks from the start that we hadn’t seen for a few days. We finished our drinks and began to walk.
                                <br><br>
                                The next town was about 9 km from our coffee break. Unfortunately the path to town was very well paved, or otherwise had enormous boulders sticking halfway out of the ground. This proved to be a problem for our feet.
                                <br><br>
                                We began to get irritated with the pain that had lasted since the night before, and decided to skip a rest stop. We trucked on through the next town, which was also nicely paved, and continued on.
                                <br><br>
                                There were 5 km left before we reached our destination in <i>Alzofra</i>. With 2 km to go, we realized we should have rested and maybe bought more coffee, because the amount of pain we were both in was almost unbearable. Even so, we managed to reach town and took a small nap as soon as we arrived.
                                <br><br>
                                Here’s to hoping tomorrow doesn’t hurt so bad.

                                May 17th, what a great day! Speaking from an unbiased opinion of course. We began our walk in the morning twilight, feeling ready for the longer day ahead of us (we planned to walk 33km to Navarette). We were almost immediately greeted with a cardio workout to get the blood pumping. We crested and dipped over a long series of steep, yet short hills. We found a bench to eat some breakfast, which consisted of smoothie packets and muffins! An interesting combo, but it go the job done.
                                <br><br>
                                By mid-day we found ourselves in a bigger town, called Logro&ntilde;o. It felt just as busy as the last big town we had been in, Pamplona, but it was a beautiful town centered along a river. We stopped for espressos and a bite to eat and I witnessed one lucky man with the Jackpot on one of those video lottery machines.
                                <br><br>
                                As we carried on, we wandered through a green, scenic park. The cement seemed to last forever, and our feet grew tired. Finally, we reached an albergue in the town of Navarette, and checked in. The man noticed it was my birthday on my passport and thus a chorus of happy birthday ensued from everyone in the lobby.
                                <br><br>
                                We decided to have dinner out, seeing as though the alburgue was serving a meal infested with lactose. We wandered the streets, but almost nothing was open yet. Most people seemed to still be on their siesta. We settled on a small bar, and sipped beer while a group of around 6-8 older women played cards (they really knew how to talk some smack!). We amused ourselves by switching between listening to the group of card players, and watching a screen showing music videos to many popular American songs (enter Taylor Swift and Kelly Clarkson). Most music videos are so weird when you watch them the entire way through. For our next stop, we went to a restaurant that the bartender suggested. We ordered burgers and were surprised when the cook walked out with two loaves of french bread, each with four patties and toppings. Talk about a burger! We went to bed that night full and content.

                                This morning was rough. Beginning our walk, my legs felt as they had at the beginning of day three. We walked along a gorgeous gravel path, tired and sore from the day before. We walked 8 kilometers to <i>Los Arcos</i> and stopped for coffee. We ran into someone we had met a few nights before, in <i>Cizur Menor</i>, and drank our coffee together and talked about the horrible hills and beautiful landscapes we have seen in the past couple of days. 
                                <br><br>
                                We all decided to walk to <i>Torres Del Rio</i>, where Paisley and I are staying tonight. We had great conversation about our futures, learning languages, work-life balance, and the third industrial revolution. The time to our albergue flew by, and we made it half an hour before check in, at about 11:30 am.
                                <br><br>
                                We checked in, changed, washed our clothes, and grabbed lunch. We had ham and cheese sandwiches and have been working on the blog.
                                <br><br>
                                Dinner is at 7 pm, and there is a pool here, so we will probably take a break and go swim in a bit. 
                                <br><br>
                                Tomorrow we are planning 33 km to Navarette, so rest will be important.

                                We woke up at 5:30 in our shoddy bunks in <i>Refugio Pellegrinos Reparadores</i> and stuffed our bags with our bed sheets and yesterday’s clothes. We walked out onto the dimly lit streets of <i>Puente la Reina</i> and made our way towards <i>Estella</i>. We had no idea Mt. Everest could be found in Spain, and that we would reach its summit before dawn. 
                                <br><br>
                                We walked through a couple of small towns looking for an open albergue to stop and grab coffee, but had a hard time finding anything open. In the third town, one that was built on the side of a mountain and had streets at a 60% grade, we found a small albergue with backpacks lining the ground in the alley outside of it. We walked in to rest our feet for a moment and grab coffee for the day ahead. From the sweat on my back I could tell that today would be very hot.
                                <br><br>
                                We made it to <i>Estella</i> just before noon, the sun was high in the sky and intensely radiating onto us. We stopped for lunch, got a few sandwiches to go, and quickly left. At this point we had 7 kilometers of steep incline left before we would be at our final destination for the day. 
                                <br><br>
                                After we had made our way out of the city, the path opened up to show a stunning panorama of rolling hills and in the distance, cliffs that seem to mark the edge of the world. We passed a fountain of wine that was probably in the wine museum that we decided not to enter, and instead made a point to find some shade, hydrate, and eat our sandwiches from earlier. 
                                <br><br>
                                The last 3 kilometers were incredibly difficult. We stumbled through town and found our albergue. We arrived at 2 pm, and had to wait an hour to check-in. Although there was a line of 20 others waiting in the shade, we were assured that there would be room for us inside. 
                                <br><br>
                                Our room was centrally located in the building with two doors on opposite walls. This served as a great shortcut for those staying in other rooms to walk through to the bathroom. 
                                <br><br>
                                Dinner was great. We had jambalaya, and although I can’t say what was in it, I recognized a few vegetables. Dessert was brownies with a cinnamon Cool-Whip. Paisley is telling me that it was delicious. 
                                <br><br>
                                We are tired and ready for a lighter day tomorrow. We traveled just over 32 kilometers today, and are planning on a cool 20 km tomorrow.

                                Today was short. We woke up early from our beds in Cizur Menor, and began to walk before sunrise. This was very peaceful, and something that we will definitely do again. One person put it so well: “...the air is buttery in the morning.” That honestly sounds like a bad time, but I understand the connection with the color of the surrounding world at that time of day. We walked fast, and although blisters hurt, we made good time. We arrived at the albergue at 11:30 am, thirty minutes before they opened for the day. We waited in the shade and rubbed our sore feet until the doors swung open and the man permitted us to check in.
                                <br><br>
                                After a shower, washing clothes, and some organizing, we worked to update this site with our adventures-- sorry for the delay. 
                                <br><br>
                                We walked around town and stumbled across some dairy-free Ben and Jerry’s! Who would have thought that this would be the greatest day ever?
                                <br><br>
                                We walked further to sit beside a very old bridge and enjoyed our ice cream in the sun, watching tourists take our photographs. They could have been trying to capture the bridge, but it looked as though they were aiming their cameras right at us.
                                <br><br>
                                In this moment it became very easy to appreciate what has brought us on this journey, and how grateful we are to be together on the other side of the world.
                                <br><br>
                                We walked to the supermarket to pick up some food for tomorrow, and found strawberries, apples, lemon pound cake, nuts, and bananas. The strawberries were the first to go.
                                <br><br>
                                We dropped off our groceries and coats only to be stopped by herd of sheep. I have never seen anything like it. It was beautiful. 
                                <br><br>
                                We walked to grab beers and dinner in the old town and sat and people watched until dark. We ate eggs and bacon, and enjoyed it with a pint of Estrella. The food was delicious, and a nice change from the large portions of bread we have been eating. 
                                <br><br>
                                We returned to the albergue, and prepared for the day ahead.

                                This was the first sunny day from beginning to end. We walked toward Pamplona with high hopes that today would be flatter than the two days prior. This was not the case-- or at least it sure didn’t seem like it. Blisters started to appear in the morning, and annoyingly pinched our feet throughout the day.
                                <br><br>
                                There were some incredible views. We were able to see Pamplona from about 10 kilometers away, which made the trek towards it quite difficult. We met a man named Dan on the side of the trail who was selling breakfast food: bananas, yogurt, boiled eggs, and coffee. He had a picture hanging up of him and Martin Sheen posing which was taken when the film crew came along this stretch of the trail. He was very friendly.
                                <br><br>
                                We made to Pamplona and walked through town looking for a place to sit and eat our sandwiches. I found a bakery that sold pastries without lactose, so I made a quick stop in to say hello. 
                                <br><br>
                                We sat in a park outside of the city, on our way out. It was easy to enjoy our sandwiches, but rather difficult to make the decision to continue walking toward our next albergue in <i>Cizur Menor</i>.
                                <br><br>
                                This albergue was stunning. There was a courtyard in which to lay down and enjoy the sun, and although the rooms were crowded, they were quiet. At least, they were for me, but Paisley did mention that my snoring seemed to ruin the atmosphere. 
                                <br><br>
                                We had a pilgrim dinner at a restaurant across the street, and it was splendid. I chose spaghetti for my first dish, and Paisley chose Paella. We both decided on veal for our second course, and Goxua for desert. I gave my slice away to someone who would be able to enjoy it, but it looked delicious.

                                It did not rain, but it was cloudy this morning and we spent the day walking steeply down the mountains. The views were wonderful, but the pain from walking across jagged stones on a steep slope made it hard to appreciate.

                                The albergue was beautiful, quiet, and clean. It is hard to ask for more than that. We hobbled from our room to the supermarket to pick up fresh bread, and canned tuna, and canned olives for lunch tomorrow. My knees have never been in as much pain. 
                                <br><br>
                                We had our first pilgrim dinner at the restaurant/supermarket across the street. This was the same place we had bought lunch an hour earlier. We ate barbequed chicken and pork, and had salad with tomatoes, eggs, tuna, and olives. We drank <i>young</i> wine that was made in town, and we were all very happy to be eating together.

                                Wow, a day as physically demanding as was today makes me wish I was still cooped up on an airplane. 
                                <br><br>
                                There was an air of excitement flowing through the street in St. Jean Pierre de Port, as everyone finished their breakfasts and took their first steps along their Camino. 
                                The excitement was needed, as today would contain about 5000 feet of elevation, and a foggy, grey view of the Pyrannies. We walked all morning, burning through carbohydrates and adrenaline, through the sideways rain that falls in this part of the world. 
                                <br><br>
                                We stopped for lunch just after the sun had chased out some of the fog. A man had parked his van along the road we were walking and was selling homemade cheese, hard-boiled eggs, some candy bars, and an assortment of canned soft drinks. We had bread and tuna from the night before, so we sat near his van and decided to eat and watch others. The first view of the trip was incredible.
                                <br><br>
                                After lunch we continued to walk. We reached the highest point not too long after lunch. Between us and the albergue, at this point, was two miles of steep decent, practically undoing all of our hard work from earlier today. 
                                It was on this stretch that I realized that walking down hill can be as challenging, or more so, than walking up hill. I don't have much to say about this part, and would rather erase most of it from my memory. 
                                <br><br>
                                The albergue was beautiful. There were maybe forty beds on the third floor of the monastery, where we were staying the night. The walls were painted white, and the vaulted ceiling that looked to be hundreds of years old had newly added skylights. Everyone was charming and delighted to be done with the first day of walking. 
                                <br><br>
                                We showered and went to find dinner. We opted out of the pilgrim dinner which we decided to try next time, and walked to a small restaurant/cafe for sandwiches and a San Miguel. 
                                <br><br> 
                                We went to bed with sore feet and tired eyes, ready to conquer the next day.

                                Phew, what a long travel day it was! We spent the majority of the day on plane or bus and discovered that there are two types of stenches: the stench of being outside and hiking without showering, and the stench of sitting in closed areas with littMalahidele circulation all day. After today I think the latter of those two is worse. We woke up at 2am, to ensure that we would get to the airport in time for our 6am flight. Turns out no one else needs a Taxi at that hour (who knew?), and we were at the airport in approximately 20 minutes. Once arriving, we walked into a deserted airport and discovered that the airline desks don’t open until 2 hours before the flight, thus found ourselves with some more time on our hands. Traveling is tricky because you don’t want to miss your flight/bus/train, yet without knowing the area or procedures of the area well, I often found myself in the “hurry up and wait” mode.
                                <br><br>
                                Once in Pamplona, after a crazy sprint through the Frankfurt airport, we got a taxi to the Pamplona bus station. While we waited, we observed many other pilgrims (what they call people who walk the Camino) strolling in and it started to make the trip seem very real to us. 
                                <br><br>
                                We caught our bus to St. Jean Pied de Port, and arrived by around 4:30pm. This next part was probably my least favorite of the trip so far. Everyone gets off the buses and sprints to try and find a hostel before they fill up. It sort of feels like everyone is on edge and in competition with one another, not two traits that are typically used to describe El Camino. You feel worried about what might happen if you can’t find a bed. In the end, all worked out and we found ourselves in a great hostel! The most friendly of the other four in our room was a German man, who was very nice, however he didn’t speak too much English. We went out for some dinner and forced ourselves to stay up all the way until 8pm.

                                We returned to Howth to spend our last day in Ireland. This time, we had the fortune of walking through town with fresh eyes to watch a bustling coastal-tourist town. We made our way straight down the main road, on the north side of the peninsula. At the end appeared a walking path and Paisley and I decided to hike around to try and catch a view of this lovely part of Ireland from above. 
                                <br><br>
                                It rained during the hike, hard. Each of us wore puffy-jackets layered under our rain coats-- both soaked completely through by the end. I’ve never heard my socks make such a noise as we stomped down the path for three and a half hours searching for “a quaint pub on the return side” as Miriam put it. 
                                <br><br>
                                Additionally, we were side tracked by a deer path leading down from the coastal cliffs to the rocky beach below. This was a fun side quest that led to a half-hour worth of skipping stones and completely soaked shoes. 
                                <br><br>
                                Towards the end of the hike we climbed to the summit of a hill on par with Everest. This led us to a golf course, and then more windy trails, and eventually to <i>The Summit Inn</i>. We had lunch and enjoyed two pints of Guinness, and then walked back to town. 
                                <br><br> 
                                When we arrived back at the Airbnb, we packed our things and then eagerly went to sleep to prepare for the next day of travel.

                                Day four was quiet. We stayed inside to sip espresso and work on our blog. It was raining outside and we started to get excited about the next leg of our adventure only a few short days away. Because we are not usually in Ireland, we decided to get out of the house and visit a town with the name Malahide. 
                                <br><br>
                                The ride on the DART was short, maybe 15 minutes. Our host had mentioned a castle here, so it was decided, that would be our first stop. Not far from the station we crossed the road into a park entrance. Along the edge, a path guided us past tennis courts, a golf course, and an outdoor stadium of somesort. 
                                <br><br>
                                Eventually we came to the castle grounds. The remains of a church stood near the entrance, across the footpath from the visitor center. Tours were available to be guided through the castle, but we decided to gaze upon it from the courtyard out front, and then walk to dinner. 
                                <br><br>
                                We decided on a cozy looking restaurant to end the day. We were seated, fed fish and wine, and walked to the docks before returning home.

                                The Cliffs of Moher being as big an icon of Ireland as they are, we figured we ought to make our way out to that side of the island. In attempting to do so, we realized the biggest downside of our time in Ireland -- we do not have a car and thus need to rely on public transportation. Public transportation is actually great over here, however it really only (easily) gets you from city to city, and makes it more difficult to see of the remote/beautiful parts of Ireland, without paying for a full day tour. None-the-less, we set out to make it to Galway and see what the day brought. 
                                <br><br>
                                We took to DART to Dublin, and then got on the LUAS to Heuston station. It is here were we got on the train for the 2.5 hr ride. Beautiful views along the way, full of cute sheep! Once in Galway, we spend the day walking the streets and getting a feel for the town. We walked out to Salt Hill via the coast and ate lunch. 
                                <br><br>
                                We then walked back and were struck by a bad case of needing a nap. In the search for a place to rest our heads we continued to tour the town. We came across an old stone arch. Very eye-opening, indeed. We also saw birds fight each other in what appeared to be a territory war for rights to a rock in a strategic fishing spot. It was great to see a city we had not yet explored, but we are ready to sleep tonight!

                                    It is all at once freeing and intimidating to be able to do anything today. We started out researching the areas of Ireland and got some pro tips from our AirBnb host, Miriam. As we planned our day in the kitchen, we were able to meet some of her Grandsons, who were staying over due to it being a bank holiday today. It was fun to hear Miriam recount her Grandson’s tennis match the previous day, as we heard his opponent described as a “little pop” and other such adjectives we did not previously know could be used to describe an individual. In the end, we settled on spending the day exploring Dublin.

                                    We went into town using the DART once again and got a great view of the city on the way in.
                                    It is incredible to see buildings that were constructed half a millenia ago-- this is a thought we shared many times as we walked through Dublin.

                                    We hopped off of the DART on Tara street, nearly directly in the city center. From there we wandered in the direction of Trinity College, with Google Maps guiding us and assuring everyone nearby that we have no idea where we are. We found ourselves at Ha'Penny bridge to snap a photo.

                                    We had scheduled a tour of the Book of Kells exhibit, and decided to tour the campus beforehand. We ended up with a few hours to spare before the tour began and so we spent our time walking through campus toward a spot for some lunch, and then toward a tourist information building and currency exchange. Woohoo, we now have Euros to burn ;)
                                    <br><br>
                                    The tour of the Book of Kells was a self-guided, museum-like walk. It began giving a history of how it came to be made and the journey that it took throughout time. Then, we proceeded to view the book itself, and enter a library which reminded us of the Citadel Library that Samwell Tarly worked in. It was built between 1712 and 1732, and the attention to detail was awe inspiring.

                                    We left and shortly met up with a friend from Pacific, Rachel, who had moved to Dublin about three weeks ago. We caught up at a nearby brewery and then headed to our next stop, GUINESS! Learned a lot about Guiness, but most importantly, we drank beers with our faces on them!! Who knew you could do that? Well, we didn’t. But now we do. All in all a fun day in Dublin!

                                It’s hard to believe, but we did not take any pictures during our first day in Dublin. With that said, our first day only lasted a few short, slightly hallucinatory, hours. We stepped off of the airplane without having slept and found a taxi to take us to our Airbnb. Then, we dropped off our bags and walked to Howth. I would like to say that in the name of adventure we would have walked around no matter the circumstance, but our room was being prepared, and we had a few hours to burn before we would be allowed to stumble onto the mattress and fall into a deep sleep for the next 15 hours.

                                Howth was incredible. A beautiful fishing village and tourist spot that has some great food and scenery. We sat down to order in a very busy restaurant, and decided on calamari, grilled tuna, and clam chowder. This was “the best clam chowder” Paisley has ever tasted. For personal reasons, I did not partake in the chowder tasting.

                                After our meal we walked to an amphitheatre-looking area that bordered the sea, and looked out toward a small island whose name I do not know.

                                We decided that enough time had been spent frolicking around and took the DART up two stops to our Airbnb. I fell asleep a few times during the 10 minute ride.

                                We are here having a breakfast of toast and jam, and Nespresso. The sun is shining through two large French Doors onto the dining room table, where we are sitting, making it incredibly difficult to see the screen I am typing on.

                                There are birds chirping outside that accent the beauty of this place very nicely. I am excited for what today brings.
